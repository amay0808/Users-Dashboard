## Overview
This project consists of a dashboard showcasing a list of users. Each user has an avatar, their name, location, and tags associated with their profile. Users can be filtered using a search bar, but the filtering functionality is not implemented in this static version. The dashboard is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Features
- **User Profiles**: Each user is displayed with their photo, name, location, and tags.
- **Search Bar**: A search bar allows users to search for specific users by name (though it doesn't currently have functional search features in the static version).
- **Tag Cloud**: Each user has tags related to their interests, which are displayed under their profile.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adapts well to various screen sizes, making it user-friendly on mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the page content.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and layout. The layout is created using Flexbox for a flexible and responsive grid system.
- **Fonts**: The project uses two Google Fonts:
  - *Poppins* for navigation and body text.
  - *Merriweather* for the header text.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:


## Design Inspirations
The design is inspired by a modern, minimalist user dashboard, focusing on simplicity and usability. It has a clean interface where the most relevant information (profile picture, name, and tags) is displayed clearly.

Key design elements include:
- **Consistent spacing**: Generous use of padding and margins to ensure a spacious and clean layout.
- **Rounded edges**: Rounded profile pictures and tags to give the design a modern and friendly feel.
- **Soft color palette**: The design uses subtle background colors and soft shadows to keep the interface clean without being overwhelming.
